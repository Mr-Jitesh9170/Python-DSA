# Operation =>

# 3. Traversing (traversing every node once in binary tree) 
    #  Type of traversing=>
    # i. Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First)
    # ii. In-order Traversal (Left, Root, Right)
    # iii. Pre-order Traversal (Root, Left, Right)
    # iv. Post-order Traversal (Left, Right, Root)
